# 0.1.2

* Fixed a crash when a LUA resource comporting errors was unloaded.
* Fixed other players (non local ones) were considered as "locally handled" by the game (when in reality they're handled by the server) causing weird behaviour to happen in some specific cases (The "random" blackscreen/loading screen bug should be fixed)
* Map trigger volumes are working properly again. (Shops sale trigger, Photo OP trigger and more...)
* Max players now goes up to **127**
* Debug menu has started to become **"Official Server Menu"** on **F9** key, this is temporary, I'm starting to transfer every stuff hardcoded in the Debug Menu into this new menu, coded in LUA on the server side, this will eventually replace the **F5** menu and will be way easier to maintain in the future. (The repo of this new menu will be also available on [github](https://github.com/SR3-MP/) when the server build will be released !)
* Removed file `debug_menu/cfg/menu_config.json` (Will not be needed anymore)
* Removed file `debug_menu/lang/english.json` (Will not be needed anymore)
* Removed file `debug_menu/lang/french.json` (Will not be needed anymore)
* Max fps value overrided by `max_fps` command no longer get reset when joining a game or quitting to main menu.
* `max_fps` and `show_fps` commands are now saved in a config file.
* CEF config file has been removed and everything has been moved to a global config file located at `./SR3MP/data/cfg/config.toml` instead of `./SR3MP/data/cef/config.toml`
* A lot of diverse refactoring here and here, and moved some codes to their respective dlls to be more consistent.
