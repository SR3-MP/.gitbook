# 0.1.1

* Completely reworked the logic of the servers list and master server, the servers list is more responsive, data are now properly refreshed (ping, players count, etc...)
* The master server (managing the servers list) now longer get stuck after a while (previously servers list was not properly refreshed)
* Completely reworked how the servers list data are shown on [https://servers.sr3mp.net](https://servers.sr3mp.net) (Loading time should be faster and servers list properly refreshed too)
* Resources manager added to the server, allowing for starting, restarting & stopping resources directly from the server, allowing a way to code LUA almost in real time, without having to restart the server and reconnecting the client
* Improved resources loading system, improving the loading time when connecting to a server
* Added LUA function `ui.get_screen_aspect_ratio`
* Added LUA function `ui.set_color`
* Added LUA function `ui.draw_rect`
* Added LUA function `ui.draw_box`
* Added LUA function `ui.draw_text`
* Added LUA function `system.get_tick_count`
* Some refactoring and other technical changes preparing for bigger updates

NOTE: Old SR3MP versions (using the old servers list system) are now deprecated.
