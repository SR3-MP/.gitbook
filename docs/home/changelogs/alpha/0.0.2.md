# 0.0.2

* Added messages when a player join or leave the game.
* Fixed nametags were not properly cleaned from memory when exiting to main menu/exiting the game.
* `updater.exe` is no longer needed, the launcher is doing the job of the updater now ! (So you won't encounter the error "Failed to launch updater !")
* The launcher is now by default always launching as administrator (preventing issues on some computers)
* Added a manual download button on the website (For ppls experiencing really slow download speed from the launcher)
* For ppls having an iGPU + a gaming GPU and experienced a blackscreen when entering the main menu, I think I found a workaround, forcing the GPU to be used instead of the iGPU, but that need to be tested since I don't have any PC with an iGPU on hand.
