# 0.1.4

* Chat commands are now handled through LUA scripting and no longer hardcoded inside the servers dlls.
* Added `/kick` command (Only available for server admins ofc)
* Added `stag_hq` location to tp list.
* Added new library `client-webrenderer.dll` to separate CEF logic from the `client-main.dll` allowing LUA API to use functions from CEF (Creating web interfaces, sending message to chat box & more...)
* When opening the chatbox the game cursor is showing instead of the normal windows cursor.
* Server LUA scripting API has been improved with more features and bugs fixes.
* Fixed a crash when some client LUA handlers were called because some game functions need to be called from the main thread to work properly, LUA handlers are now handled in the main thread.
* Improved log and config system.
* Reworked the network packets sender system, every packets get synchronized with the network thread before being sent over the network (50Hz thread loop), leading to less packets loss and preventing packets overflow.
* Added `inactive_entities_cooldown` in the server config file, this value is used to delete inactive entities after a certain amount of time. This is mainly used as a debug feature for now.
* Moved SR3MP watermark in the bottom right corner of the screen.
* Moved fps counter to the top right corner of the screen.
