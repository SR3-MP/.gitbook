# 0.0.4

* Fixed a weird bug when connecting a gamepad (or alt tabbing for some ppls) was causing vehicles to despawn or glitch inside the ground, this bug is also suspected to be the bug where players get suddenly stuck on other players perspective ! (Need more testing to be confirmed)
* Added FPS counter on the top left corner
* Added console command `max_fps` (Range from 10 to 1000)
* Added chat command `/killme` (Useful if you're stuck or to debug stuff)
* You can no longer toggle **No Clip**, **Hide HUD** when the game is paused (Fixing the bug when pressing F2 in the settings menu was hiding the HUD at the same time)
* `/weather` command now display the weather name (`/weather 0` will display `"PlayerName" updated weather to Clear Skies`)
* Vehicles like heli, boats, etc... (or bigger vehicle in general) no longer spawn in the ground
* Some internal codes refactoring preparing for future updates
