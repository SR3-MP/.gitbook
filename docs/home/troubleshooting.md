# ðŸ§° Troubleshooting

Below you will find a list of the common issues you can encounter when installing or using SR3MP.

## Why launching the mod is starting the vanilla game instead ?

It can be caused by multiple reasons, but the most common is probably because there is missing files in your installation.

First, try to reinstall SR3MP, if the problem persist, you can also try to disable your antivirus, sometimes Windows Defender or other antivirus can delete files of SR3MP, since the antivirus doesn't know about theses files, it automatically trigger them as dangerous, this is a false positive.

If the issue still persist, you can also try to install manually SR3MP, using the [manual download](https://sr3mp.net/index.php?page=download\&file=SR3MP-Release.rar).

## Why I'm experiencing a blackscreen when entering the main menu ?

It can be caused by your PC using the wrong GPU, if you have an iGPU, in some cases the computer decide to use it instead of your dedicated graphics card. You can try to force the program to use your dedicated GPU.

## Why the download speed is so slow during the installation ?
