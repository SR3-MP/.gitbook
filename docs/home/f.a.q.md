## <mark style="color:purple;">Does this mod work for the original</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**Saints Row The Third**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">?</mark>

No, the original game doesn't come with all the DLCs out of the box, so it could be a bit difficult to manage players with and without DLCs when joining a server, on the other hand the remastered version is the same on all platforms. An other reason is also because the remastered version is 64 bits, it's easier for modding and has less limitations to extend the modding in the future.

## <mark style="color:purple;">On which platform is it available ?</mark>

SR3MP is working with [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/saints\_row\_the\_third\_remastered), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/978300/Saints\_Row\_The\_Third\_Remastered/) & [Epic](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/saints-row-the-third-remastered) version of the game.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Does your mod use the original netcode of the game ?</mark>

No, it's a custom netcode, using dedicated servers, allowing for deeper modifications and a better stability.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Is the mod free to play ?</mark>

Yes, the mod is entirely f2p, however if you want to support our work, you can on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SR3MP).

## <mark style="color:purple;">Can I play SR3MP on a pirated version of the game ?</mark>

No, you need a legally purchased copy of **Saints Row The Third: Remastered**.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Do I need to backup my game files before installing SR3MP ?</mark>

No, SR3MP doesn't affect any of the existing game files, it's a standalone mod that use it's own install folder.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Does SR3MP is compatible with existing mods ?</mark>

No, it's not recommended to join a server with modified game files, it can cause bugs or crashes. In the future, joining a server with modified game files will be prohibited. (Except if the server owner decide to authorize modified game files)

## <mark style="color:purple;">Can we play coop missions ?</mark>

No, SR3MP is comparable to FiveM, Garry's Mod or Roblox, it's more of a sandbox you can build on, our goal is not to recreate a "coop" mod with more players !

## <mark style="color:purple;">What is the maximum amount of players you can handle with your mod ?</mark>

Up to 31 players yet, however this current "limitation" can still be extended in the future.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Do you have any plans to create mods on other Saints Row titles ?</mark>

No, eventually **Saints Row 2**, but the game is broken like hell on PC, a fully patched version would be required at first.
